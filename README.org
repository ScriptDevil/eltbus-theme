#+title: Eltbus is subtle


* Guiding principles 
  
** Don't distract
   - Extremely subtle colours

** Let syntax-highlighting do some work for you
   - Syntax highlighting is distracting, but it does serve a purpose.
   - Cryptic errors arise from unclosed comments and unterminated strings.

** Important things stand out
   - Highlighting Keywords, types and builtins provides a mental note
     to self that you haven't mistyped
   - giving a different color/formatting style to links helps too.
   
** Unimportant things dont
   - Comments are often useless when coding
   - Doc-comments are slightly more usefu
     - These stand out a little more than normal comments

* Get involved
  - Emacs has several font-faces. You can see this using
    #+begin_verbatim
    M-x list-faces-display 
    #+end_verbatim
    
  - If you are on a particular word and wonder what highlighting it
    uses, use
    #+begin_verbatim
    M-x describe-faces
    #+end_verbatim
       
  - If you feel =eltbus= is doing a bad job with it, add another entry
    for it and send me a PR. If it is subtle enough, I will pull
